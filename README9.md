EXPERIMENT 9:
AIM:

To study and implement the NumPy library in Python for creating arrays and performing basic array operations, in-built functions, and matrix operations.

THEORY:

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.
In this experiment:
NumPy arrays are created using array() for one-dimensional and two-dimensional data.
Arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication are performed directly on arrays.
Properties like dimension, shape, and data type of arrays are studied.
In-built functions such as zeros(), ones(), eye(), arange(), and linspace() are used to generate arrays.
Statistical functions like mean(), median(), max(), min(), and sum() are applied on arrays.
Linear algebra operations including determinant, transpose, and dot product are performed using NumPy’s linear algebra module.
NumPy improves performance and simplifies complex mathematical computations compared to Python lists.

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source Python library that is widely used for numerical computation, scientific computing, data analysis, and engineering applications. It provides a fast and efficient way to work with large datasets and perform complex mathematical operations. NumPy forms the foundation for many other Python libraries such as SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Machine Learning frameworks.
The core feature of NumPy is the ndarray (N-dimensional array), which is a homogeneous data structure capable of storing elements of the same data type. Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays consume less memory and provide faster execution because they are stored in contiguous memory locations. This makes NumPy highly suitable for numerical calculations.
In this experiment, NumPy arrays are created using different methods. One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays are created using the array() function. Special functions like zeros(), ones(), and eye() are used to create arrays filled with zeros, ones, and identity matrices respectively. The arange() and linspace() functions help in generating arrays with evenly spaced values, which is useful in mathematical modeling and simulations.
NumPy allows direct arithmetic operations on arrays such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are performed element-wise without using loops, which simplifies the code and improves performance. Broadcasting is another important feature of NumPy that allows operations between arrays of different shapes under certain rules.
The experiment also involves studying array attributes such as shape, size, dimension (ndim), and data type (dtype). These attributes provide useful information about the structure and memory usage of arrays. Indexing and slicing techniques are used to access specific elements or sub-arrays efficiently.
Statistical and mathematical operations are an important part of NumPy. Functions like sum(), mean(), median(), min(), and max() are used to analyze numerical data. These functions help in data analysis and interpretation. NumPy also supports universal functions (ufuncs) that perform fast element-wise operations such as square root, power, logarithm, and trigonometric functions.
Additionally, NumPy provides a Linear Algebra module (linalg) that supports matrix operations such as transpose, determinant, inverse, and dot product. These operations are widely used in engineering, physics, and machine learning applications. Matrix multiplication using NumPy is simpler and faster compared to traditional looping methods.
Overall, NumPy plays a crucial role in scientific and numerical computing by providing efficient data structures and high-performance mathematical functions. Its simplicity, speed, and flexibility make it an essential library for Python programmers working in data science and computational fields.

CONCLUSION:

Thus, the NumPy library was successfully studied and implemented to perform array creation, mathematical operations, statistical calculations, and matrix operations efficiently in Python.
