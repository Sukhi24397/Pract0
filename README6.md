Experiment:
 Study of conditional statements in python 

 AIM:
 
 To study and understand conditional statements in Python and to learn how decision-making is performed using if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements.

Theory:

In Python, conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a given condition is True or False. These conditions are usually formed using relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=) and logical operators (and, or, not).
Types of Conditional Statements in Python
if statement
Executes a block of code only if the condition is true.
if–else statement
Executes one block if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.
if–elif–else statement
Used when there are multiple conditions to be checked.
The first true condition’s block is executed.
Nested if statement
An if statement written inside another if statement.
Used for checking conditions within conditions.
Conditional statements help in making programs dynamic, logical, and decision-oriented, which is essential in real-world applications like grading systems, eligibility checks, and menu-driven programs.
